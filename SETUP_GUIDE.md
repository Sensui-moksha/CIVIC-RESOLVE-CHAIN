# DeFix: Civic Problem Solving Platform - Setup Guide

## ÔøΩ Introduction

This guide provides specific instructions for setting up the DeFix platform on your local environment and deploying it for public use. DeFix is a specialized application for communities to report civic problems, propose solutions, and distribute rewards using the Aptos blockchain.

## ÔøΩÔ∏è Development Environment Setup

### Required Software

1. **Node.js & NPM**:
   - Install Node.js v18 or higher from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
   - Verify installation: `node -v && npm -v`

2. **Aptos CLI**:
   - For Windows: Download binary from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aptos-labs/aptos-core/releases)
   - For macOS: `brew install aptos`
   - For Linux: Use the AppImage from GitHub Releases
   - Add to PATH and verify: `aptos --version`

3. **Petra Wallet**:
   - Install from [petra.app](https://petra.app/) or Chrome Web Store
   - Create new wallet or import existing one
   - Switch network to Testnet for development

4. **Code Editor**: 
   - Visual Studio Code recommended
   - Install TypeScript and React extensions

## ÔøΩ Project Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/civic-resolve-chain.git
cd civic-resolve-chain
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Local Config
Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
```
VITE_IPFS_API_KEY=your_nft_storage_api_key
```

### 4. Setup IPFS Storage

You'll need an NFT.Storage account for storing problem evidence and solution images:

1. Register at [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/)
2. Create a new API key from the dashboard
3. Copy the API key (starts with `eyJ...`)

## üîë Getting API Keys

### NFT.Storage API Token

1. Visit [NFT.Storage](https://nft.storage/)
2. Sign up with your email or GitHub
3. Go to **API Keys** section
4. Create a new API key
5. Copy the token (starts with `eyJ...`)

**Token Format**: `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...`

‚ö†Ô∏è **Security Note**: API tokens are stored locally in your browser's localStorage for convenience. Never share your tokens.

## ÔøΩ Smart Contract Deployment

Follow these precise steps to deploy the DeFix smart contract to Aptos:

### 1. Set Up Aptos Account

```bash
# Initialize your Aptos account (creates ~/.aptos/config.yaml)
aptos init --network testnet

# Fund your account with test tokens
aptos account fund-with-faucet --account default
```

### 2. Compile and Publish Contract

```bash
# Navigate to the contracts directory
cd contracts

# Compile the Move contract
aptos move compile

# If compilation succeeds, publish the contract
# Replace with your actual account address
aptos move publish --named-addresses defix=0x123...your_address_here
```

### 3. Verify Deployment

```bash
# Check that your module is published
aptos account list --query modules

# Save your account address - you'll need this as the "Module Address" in the app
aptos account list | grep default
```

### 4. Store Contract Address

After successful deployment, copy your account address. You'll need to enter this as the "Module Address" when setting up the app.

## üíª Running the Application

### Start Development Server

```bash
# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

### First-Time Configuration

When you first open the application:

1. Click "Connect Wallet" and approve the connection request in Petra
2. Enter your NFT.Storage API key when prompted
3. Enter your deployed contract address (from the previous section)
4. Allow location access for the map functionality

### Building for Production

```bash
# Create optimized production build
npm run build

# Preview the production build locally
npm run preview
```

## üöÄ Deployment Guide

### GitHub Pages Deployment

| Pinata | JWT format | Enter in app or use env variable |
| Web3.Storage | API token | Enter in app or use env variable |

### Network Configuration

To switch between Testnet and Mainnet, modify `src/utils/aptos.ts`:

```typescript
// For testnet (development)
const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.TESTNET });

// For mainnet (production)
// const config = new AptosConfig({ network: Network.MAINNET });
```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file for local development:

```
# Required
VITE_IPFS_TOKEN=your_nft_storage_api_key

# Optional
VITE_NETWORK=testnet  # or mainnet
VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x123...  # pre-filled contract address
```

For production, set these variables in your hosting platform.
